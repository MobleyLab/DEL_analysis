# data_analysis

## What's here:
### script
- `analysis.ipynb`: notebook outlining analysis from paper with additional visualizations
- `analysis_tools.py`: set of helper functions to perform analysis
- `gen_figures.ipynb`: notebook with more involved code to produce all the figures from the manuscript

## Procedure
All primary results can be generated by running the `analysis.ipynb` notebook. Implications of the various analyses are detailed in the main text of the manuscript.

The notebook requires a curated DEL dataset and a list of building blocks at each position of the library -- both of which can be generated by the code in `data_preparation` -- and similarity matrices for building blocks at each position. Calculation of either 2D Tanimoto or 3D Tanimoto combo scores for building blocks is described in `similarity_calculation`.
