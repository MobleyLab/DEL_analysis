# SI

## What's here:
- `analysis.ipynb`: notebook with code to reproduce all analysis in the Supporting Information of the manuscript
- `SI_tools.py`: suite of helper functions for analysis
- `auc_{75,90,95}_3D.csv`: AUC results from 50 random initializations of 75/25, 90/10 and 95/5 train/test splitting, respectively

## Procedure
We provide all necessary code to reproduce the figures in the Supporting Information of the manuscript. This can all be done by running the `analysis.ipynb` notebook.
